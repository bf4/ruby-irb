This is the original commit of the rtags source code as written by Keiju
ISHITSUKA as part of the irb project. Now irb has moved into the main Ruby
source tree rtags has become an independent project.

At this point you can just run rtags in lieu of ctags, provided irb is
installed on your system. It works alright! You may see quite a
number of warning messages (certainly with projects like Ruby on
Rails) - usually because of multiple line definitions. It is safe to
ignore those warnings.

rtags is distributed as a gem or tgz file under a RUBY LICENSE and is
hosted at rubyforge:

  http://rubyforge.org/projects/rtags/

The home page and tutorial can be found at
