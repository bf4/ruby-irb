## [rtags](https://github.com/gaizka/rtags)

> This is the original commit of the rtags source code as written by Keiju
ISHITSUKA as part of the irb project. Now irb has moved into the main Ruby
source tree rtags has become an independent project.

## [Pickaxe](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/irb.html)

> rtags, xmp, and the Frame Class
> The base version of irb is installed along with Ruby itself. But there is an extended version of irb in the archives containing a few extra goodies that need mentioning.
> rtags
> rtags is a command used to create a TAGS file for use with either the emacs or vi editor.
> By default, rtags makes a TAGS file suitable for emacs (see etags.el). The -vi option makes a TAGS file for use with vi.
> rtags needs to be installed in the same manner as irb (that is, you need to install irb in the library path and make a link from `irb/rtags.rb` to `bin/rtags`).
